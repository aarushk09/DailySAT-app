      "questionDescription": "The following text is adapted from Johanna Spyriʼs 1881 novel Heidi (translated by Elisabeth Stork in 1915). Eight-\nyear-old Heidi and her friendʼs grandmother are looking at some illustrated books.\nHeidi had come and was looking with wondering eyes at the splendid pictures in the large books, that\nGrandmama was showing her. Suddenly she screamed aloud, for there on the picture she saw a peaceful\nflock grazing on a green pasture. In the middle a shepherd was standing, leaning on his crook. The setting\nsun was shedding a golden light over everything. With glowing eyes Heidi devoured the scene.",

      },
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most effectively states the main idea of the text, which is that Heidi is\ndelighted and fascinated by an image she sees in one of Grandmama’s books. In the text, Heidi screams upon\n\u0000rst seeing the picture of the green pasture. In another context, such a reaction might suggest fear, but here\nthe reaction is followed by descriptions of an image that’s peaceful rather than scary. The text goes on to\ndescribe Heidi’s eyes as “glowing” and states that she “devoured the scene,” suggesting that the image delights\nand fascinates her so much that she wants to examine every detail. Together, these descriptions suggest that\nHeidi is thrilled and intrigued by the image in the book.\nChoice A is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Heidi is upset before seeing the\npeaceful image of the green pasture. Before Heidi sees that image, the text describes her as “looking with\nwondering eyes at the splendid pictures” in the book, suggesting that Heidi is intrigued, not that she’s\nunhappy. Choice C is incorrect. Although Heidi screams upon \u0000rst seeing the image, the text’s description of\nthe image and Heidi’s other reactions to it suggest that she is screaming with delight, not fear. The text\ndescribes the images in the book as “splendid” and the particular image that causes her to scream as peaceful\nrather than frightening. It also describes Heidi’s eyes as “glowing” and states that she “devoured the scene,”\nsuggesting that the image of the green pasture delights and fascinates her so much that she wants to examine\nevery detail. Choice D is incorrect because it’s unclear from the text whether Heidi has ever seen a shepherd\n==================================================\n=== Page 2 ===\nwith his sheep before.

      "questionDescription": "Shimmering is a collective defense behavior that researchers have observed in giant honeybee colonies. When\nshimmering, different groups of bees flip their bodies up and down in what looks like waves. This defense is\ninitiated when hornets hover near a colony, serving to deter the hornets from approaching the bees.

The text\ngoes on to discuss O’Brien and Ahmed’s study as a \"case in point\" (that is, as an example of the point made\npreviously). According to the text, O’Brien and Ahmed hypothesized that since standing is more cognitively\ndemanding than sitting, standing subjects in their experiment would respond differently to decision-making\ntasks than sitting subjects would, which would show an effect of posture on cognition. What the researchers\nactually found, however, was that the standing and sitting subjects performed the same—posture did not affect\ncognition. By presenting a circumstance in which posture does not appear to affect cognition, the discussion\nof O’Brien and Ahmed’s study shows why it is important not to overstate the phenomenon.

      "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it describes data in the graph that support Meng and colleagues’\nconclusion that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T. According to\nthe text, payload capacity is calculated by using a ratio of a robot’s holding force to the robot’s weight, and\nhigher ratios indicate a greater payload capacity. The Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a holding force of 56 newtons,\nfour times greater than that of the Yale Model T. Additionally, the graph shows that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand\nhas a weight of approximately 500 grams, slightly more than the Yale Model T’s weight of approximately 480\ngrams. Therefore, the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher ratio of holding force to weight than the Yale Model\nT. Since higher ratios correspond to greater payload capacity, the information from the graph indicating that\nthe Ultra-Fast Robot Hand weighs only slightly more than the Yale Model T combined with the information in\nthe text ultimately supports the conclusion that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than\nthe Yale Model T.\nChoice A is incorrect. Although, according to the graph, it’s true that both the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the\nYale Model T weigh more than 450 grams, this statement doesn’t support Meng and colleagues’ conclusion\nthat the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T. This statement\nemphasizes a similarity, not a distinction, between the two robots. Choice B is incorrect. Although, according\nto the graph, it’s true that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T both weigh more than the\nPermanent Magnet Hand does, this statement doesn’t support Meng and colleagues’ conclusion that the Ultra-\nFast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T. This statement emphasizes a similarity,\nnot a distinction, between the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T. Furthermore, the comparison to the\nPermanent Magnet Hand is irrelevant to the claim about the relative ratios and payload capacities of the Ultra-\nFast Robot Hand and the Yale Model T. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text states that the Yale Model T has\na lower holding force than the Permanent Magnet Hand, the graph provides no information about holding\nforce.

The text states that Coll and colleagues\nreported almost double the number of species that Bianchi and Morri reported in their study ten years earlier.\nAccording to the text, this difference can only be partly attributed to new invertebrate species being described\nin the years between the two studies, which means there must be an additional factor that made Coll and\ncolleagues’ count so much higher than Bianchi and Morri’s count. The text goes on to explain that factor:\nresearchers have a relatively poor understanding of microorganisms’ morphological variability, or the\ndifferences in microorganisms’ structure and form. This poor understanding makes it hard to classify\nmicroorganisms by species and means that researchers’ decisions about classifying microorganisms can have\na large effect on the overall species counts that researchers report. Additionally, the text says that the two\ncensuses reported similar numbers of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, which means that the difference in\noverall species did not come from differences in those categories.

If Bianchi\nand Morri had been less sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, Bianchi and Morri\nwould likely have reported more species than Coll and colleagues did, since less sensitivity to within-species\nvariation would lead researchers to classify as different species microorganisms that more sensitive\nresearchers would classify as variations within the same species. The text indicates, however, that Bianchi\nand Morri reported far fewer species than Coll and colleagues did; since the text also excludes other\nexplanations for this difference, it suggests that in fact Bianchi and Morri were more sensitive to within-\nspecies variation than Coll and colleagues were, leading Bianchi and Morri to report fewer overall\nspecies. Choice D is incorrect because the text is focused on explaining why Coll and colleagues reported\nmany more species than Bianchi and Morri did, and an underestimate of the number of microorganism\nspecies by Coll and colleagues would not explain that difference—it would suggest, in fact, that the difference\nin the number of species should have been even larger.\nQuestion Dif\u0000culty: Hard\n==================================================\n=== Page 551 ===",

The text indicates that\nscholars used to believe that during the Classic period, the Maya civilization didn’t have agricultural\nmarketplaces. According to the text, scholars held this view because they misunderstood the ecology of areas\nwhere the Maya lived. The text points out that people tend to create marketplaces in order to acquire resources\nthey don’t otherwise control. Agricultural marketplaces would have allowed farmers who produced one type of\ncrop to trade that crop for other types of crops that they didn’t produce. The text goes on to say, however, that\nscholars underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya areas, meaning that scholars thought that the\nMaya landscape produced a smaller range of resources than it actually produced. Taken together, then, this\ninformation suggests that scholars assumed that marketplaces wouldn’t have allowed Maya people to acquire\nproducts different from the products they already produced: that is, if everyone produced the same array of\ncrops, as scholars mistakenly believed, then there wouldn’t have been any need for marketplaces where\npeople could trade those crops.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t say anything about trade between the Maya and people from\noutside the regions controlled by the Maya. Although scholars’ mistaken belief that the Maya lands weren’t\nvery ecologically diverse would give those scholars a reason to think that the Maya didn’t have marketplaces,\nit wouldn’t lead scholars to assume that traders from outside Maya lands were uninterested in acquiring\nresources produced by the Maya. Even if the Maya actually did produce only a small array of resources\n==================================================\n=== Page 554 ===\nthroughout their lands, there is no reason to believe from the text that people outside Maya lands also\nproduced these same resources and thus would have no need to trade with the Maya people. Choice B is\nincorrect because the text indicates that scholars underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya lands,\nwhich suggests that they mistakenly believed that the Maya produced a relatively small array of resources\nthroughout their territory, not that the crops the Maya produced varied signi\u0000cantly throughout the Maya\nlands. Although the scholars might have assumed that a lack of ecological diversity suggests that Maya\nfarming practices were largely the same everywhere, the text does not support that they also assumed there\nwas a lot of variation in the crops that Maya people produced. In fact, the text states that marketplaces emerge\nwhen people want to obtain resources they don’t already control. If it were the case that scholars assumed that\nthe crops Maya people produced varied signi\u0000cantly, this would have led them to conclude that Maya people\nlikely established marketplaces so they could trade for resources they didn’t already possess, not that the\nMaya civilization lacked marketplaces. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that\nscholars assumed that farmers wouldn’t trade their agricultural products unless they had already met their\nown needs with those products. Instead, the text says that scholars thought that the Maya lands produced a\nsmaller array of resources than they actually did, which the text suggests led scholars to assume that the\nMaya didn’t have any need for marketplaces.

The text indicates that The Books of Jacob has a large cast of\ncharacters, a complicated and wandering plot (that is, a plot that is dif\u0000cult to follow), and reverse page\nnumbering. Together, these features make up a novel that’s challenging to read and summarize. This context\nsupports the idea that a brief book review can’t do justice to the novel’s complexity.\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the word “accuracy,” or being free from error or falsehood, can sometimes be\nused to describe a novel, the text doesn’t discuss whether Tokarczuk’s novel has this quality. Instead, the text\ndescribes the novel as having a large cast of characters, a dif\u0000cult-to-follow plot, and reverse page numbering.\nThese features suggest complexity, not accuracy. Choice B is incorrect because “inactivity” means being in a\nstate of idleness or doing nothing, neither of which would make sense in this context. The text describes\nTokarczuk’s novel, and although it’s possible the novel could portray its characters as inactive, it wouldn’t\nmake sense to describe the novel itself as such. Choice D is incorrect because in this context “restraint” would\nmean holding back or showing self-control, and the text doesn’t indicate that Tokarczuk’s novel has either of\nthese qualities. In fact, the features of the novel that the text describes, such as a large cast of characters, a\ncomplicated and wandering plot, and reverse page numbering, suggest excess and complexity, not restraint.\nQuestion Dif\u0000culty: Easy\n==================================================\n=== Page 642 ===",

      "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer. A person who is \"dogmatic\" believes strongly that their principles and opinions\nare true. Because Du Bois and Locke are implied to have one \"uni\u0000ed vision\" of Black American identity that\nthey prioritize over the \"diverse perspectives\" of different writers, they can be described as dogmatic.\nChoice A is incorrect. \"Pro\u0000cient\" means \"skilled.\" Du Bois and Locke are contrasted with Johnson, but nothing\nin the text suggests that Johnson was not skilled at making editorial decisions. Based on the text, the three\neditors just have different styles; they’re not necessarily more or less skilled. Choice C is incorrect.\n\"Ambiguous\" means \"unclear\" or \"open to multiple interpretations.\" However, it’s actually Johnson who\nencouraged multiple interpretations (\"diverse perspectives\"). Since Du Bois and Locke are said to \"diverge\"\nfrom Johnson, we can assume that the views they published were not ambiguous, but instead clear and \u0000rm (a\n\"uni\u0000ed vision\"). Choice D is incorrect. \"Unpretentious\" means \"not trying to impress others with greater skill\nor importance than is actually possessed.\" Du Bois and Locke are contrasted with Johnson, but nothing in the\ntext suggests that Johnson is pretentious (trying to impress others).\nQuestion Dif\u0000culty: Hard\n==================================================\n=== Page 694 ===",

      "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the sounds made by\ngüiros. In this context, “variable” means able to change. The text begins by explaining that güiros are\ninstruments made out of hollowed gourds with ridges cut into their sides and that players scrape the ridges\nwith wooden sticks to produce sounds. The text goes on to say that güiros’ sounds can change depending on\ngourd thickness, the distance between ridges, and the types of strokes the player uses, thus supporting the\nidea that the sounds created by these instruments are variable.\nChoice A is incorrect because “overlooked” means not being seen or noticed, and there is nothing in the text to\nsuggest that the sounds produced by güiros are overlooked or not noticed. Choice B is incorrect because in this\ncontext, “powerful” would mean having a great ability to produce an effect. While it’s possible that the sounds\nproduced by güiros have a strong effect on listeners, the text doesn’t discuss this aspect of their sounds.\nChoice C is incorrect because “routine” means usual and unvarying, and there is nothing in the text to suggest\nthat the sounds produced by güiros are unvarying.

In this context, “commonalities with” means similarities to or shared attributes with.\nThe text indicates that a recently discovered citadel in Tikal includes a close imitation of a famous temple in\nTeotihuacán (another Mesoamerican city) and other evidence of Teotihuacán in\u0000uence, which suggests that the\ncitadel possesses features that resemble architectural features found in Teotihuacán. This context thus indicates\nthat the Tikal citadel shows commonalities with Teotihuacán architecture.\nChoice A is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text that suggests that the Tikal citadel shows “re\u0000nements of,”\nor improvements on, Teotihuacán architecture. Although the text suggests that the architecture of Teotihuacán\nin\u0000uenced the architecture of the Tikal citadel, and although it’s possible that later architectural designs could\nmake improvements on earlier designs, the text doesn’t discuss whether, in imitating Teotihuacán architecture, the\nTikal citadel’s builders improved on it. Choice B is incorrect because describing the citadel in Tikal as showing\n“precursors of” Teotihuacán architecture—or features that preceded and foreshadowed those of Teotihuacán\narchitecture—would imply the opposite of what the text suggests about the relationship between the architecture\nfound in Tikal and Teotihuacán. The text claims that the discovery of similarities between the Tikal citadel and the\narchitecture of Teotihuacán, including a replica of a temple in Teotihuacán, provides evidence of outside in\u0000uences\non Tikal architecture. If the Tikal citadel was in\u0000uenced by Teotihuacán architecture, then the Teotihuacán\narchitecture must predate the citadel, not the other way around.

In this context, “homogeneous” means uniform or of the same kind.

The text goes on to say, however, that Jha and Kremen identi\u0000ed a circumstance in which bees don’t\nbehave this way. Speci\u0000cally, if bees encounter “patches of low species richness”—that is, patches in which the\n\u0000owers are largely from the same species—they’ll travel beyond those patches to get varied food resources. This\ncontext thus suggests that bees don’t behave as some models predict if the dense patches of \u0000owers the bees\nencounter are homogeneous.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text indicates that Jha and Kremen found that bees will behave differently than\nsome models predict if the bees encounter \u0000ower patches that are not rich in species, not if the \u0000owers are\n“depleted,” or emptied or reduced in quality or quantity. Although it could be true that bees are likely to leave\ndepleted patches in search of more resources, the text doesn’t indicate that Jha and Kremen investigated that\npossibility.
