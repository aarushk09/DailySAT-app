              The decline of bee populations worldwide has alarmed scientists and environmentalists alike. These insects are responsible for pollinating approximately 75% of the fruits, nuts, and vegetables grown in the United States. Without bees, many crops would fail, threatening food security globally. Recent studies have linked this decline to pesticide use, habitat loss, and climate change, prompting calls for more sustainable agricultural practices and conservation efforts.
